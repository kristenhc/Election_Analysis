# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
The Colorado board of elections has tasked us to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. Using python and imported csv module, we are able to read the csv file (containing fields: ballot ID, county, and candidate), perform basic anaylses, and write the results to a .txt file.

Election Audit Objectives:
1. Total number of votes cast.
2. Complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Breakdown of each *candidate's number of votes and the percentage of total votes cast.
4. Winner of the election based on popular vote.
5. Breakdown of each *county's number of votes and percentage of total votes cast.
6. County with the largest number of votes.
